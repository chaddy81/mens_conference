              <h1>Men For All Seasons</h1>
              <h3>Courage • Faith • Action</h3>
              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>Our families and communities are in need of men willing and able to lead others closer to Jesus Christ. Understanding what it is to be a man requires a strong life of faith and a good relationship with Him first.</p>

              <p>The 2016 Green Bay Men’s Conference meets men wherever they’re at in their life. Whether you are Catholic or not, practicing your faith, or have been away for a lifetime. We’ll do this by connecting everyday guys with great speakers who will lift them up, give them courage to be more than they are today and depend on God’s strength to do so.</p>

              <p>Men ages 12 to a 102 are welcome to join us for a day of prayer, engaging talks and connecting with organizations that will help them be more. And this conference will be more than a one day opportunity, it will be a beginning to a new chapter in your life as a man who leads, prays and lives with new life unlike far beyond what you’ve experienced before.</p>

              <h2>Coach Mike McCarthy</h2>

              <p>Born Michael John McCarthy on November 10, 1963, in Pittsburgh, he grew up one of five children in the Irish-Catholic family of father Joe and mother Ellen in Greenfield, a Pittsburgh neighborhood just a couple of miles from downtown. He earned a degree in business administration and was an all-conference tight end and senior captain in 1986 at Baker University in Baldwin City, Kansas.Then, he earned a master’s degree in sports administration while coaching linebackers at Fort Hays State under head coach John Vincent.</p>

              <h2>Harry Sydney</h2>

              <p>Harry Sydney played professional football for 10 seasons, and coached running backs with the Packers for six. He won Super Bowl Championships with the San Francisco 49ers in 1988 and 1989, and with the Green Bay Packers as their running backs coach in 1996. When Sydney retired from the NFL he launched a non-profit organization called "My Brother’s Keeper" because he wanted to make a difference in the community of Green Bay which he now called home.</p>

              <p>He possesses a degree in criminology and juvenile justice from the University of Kansas. He and his wife have a blended family of eight children and 5 grandchildren.</p>

              <p>Although Harry enjoyed a very successful career in the NFL, his path was full of disappointment and hard work. He came from a childhood filled with abuse, alcoholism, divorce and an environment filled with prejudice. Having overcome these obstacles, he has dedicated himself through the ministry he founded to help others find success in dealing with the hardships in their lives.</p>

              <p>Harry’s willingness to work with men – one step at a time – brings forth positive change in their lives. His dedication to the boys and men in the program goes above and beyond the long hours at the office. He makes himself available at all hours to anyone who is in need, and is making a real difference in his community.</p>
